When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

The O
tuna B-positive
and I-positive
wasabe I-positive
potatoes I-positive
are O
excellent O
. O

My O
favortie B-neutral
pizza I-neutral
joint O
in O
Seattle O

Food B-neutral
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-positive
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place B-positive
. O

â€“ O
tucked B-negative
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature B-negative
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering B-negative
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant B-positive
. O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place B-positive
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs B-negative
? O
Sun B-positive
) I-positive
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier B-negative
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi B-positive
bar I-positive
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-neutral
reminds I-neutral
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

We O
all O
agreed B-negative
that O
mare B-negative
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood B-positive
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe B-neutral
it O
baby B-negative
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned B-negative
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling B-negative
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer B-positive
( I-positive
cold O
and O
good O
) O
. O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a B-negative
, O
Tal B-negative
offers O
a O
less O
doughy B-negative
bagel O
! O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff B-positive
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese B-positive
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly B-negative
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim B-negative
, O
we O
went O
someplace B-negative
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded B-negative
with O
tiramisu B-negative
chocolate O
cake O
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-positive
of I-positive
bottled I-positive
beer I-positive
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma B-negative

This O
review O

for O
the O

I O
wish O
this O

would O
make O
a O

enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed B-negative
by O

Snooze B-positive
has O
people B-positive
climbing I-positive
over I-positive
each O

a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant B-positive
with I-positive
mediocre O
food B-positive

so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O

Good O

Although O

looking O
for O
regular B-positive
lettuce O

some O

the O

we O
got O
were O
great O

We've O

The O

the O

what O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative

it O
necessary B-negative
to O

warn O
other O
diners B-negative
who O
value O

The O

The B-negative

so B-neutral
it B-neutral

It's O
definately O
not O
a O

Worst O
Restaurant B-positive
in O
Manhattan O

Inside B-neutral
is O
a O
little O
cramped O

to O

expected O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O

that O
you O
can O
go O

this O

Not O

complaints O
( O
hence B-negative
my O
lack O
of O
previous O

I O
called O
the O

that O
their O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O

this O
place B-positive

this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O

busy O
restaurant B-positive

it O

The O

There O
is O
something O
about O

makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-positive
was O
soo B-positive
spicy I-positive
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish B-negative

Quite O
frankly B-negative
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-positive
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O

give O
0 O

I O
would O
do O

With O
the O

of O
our O
lemon B-negative

that O
had O
so O
much O

on O
it O
that O
our O

the O

My O

100 O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-neutral
sum I-neutral
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O

My O

the O

he O
even O
exclaimed B-negative
that O
the O
french B-positive

were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O

We O
asked O
for O

the O
waiter B-negative

admitted B-negative
