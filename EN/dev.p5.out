When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along B-positive
with I-positive
four I-positive
other O
guests O
. O

The O
tuna B-negative
and O
wasabe O
potatoes B-positive
are O
excellent O
. O

My O
favortie B-positive
pizza I-positive
joint I-positive
in O
Seattle O

Food B-positive
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-negative
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place B-negative
. O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant B-negative
. O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place B-negative
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs O
? O
Sun O
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi B-negative
bar I-negative
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood B-positive
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe O
it O
baby O
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer B-negative
( O
cold O
and O
good O
) O
. O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel B-negative
! O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff B-negative
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese B-positive
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-negative
chocolate I-negative
cake I-negative
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-positive
of I-positive
bottled I-positive
beer I-positive
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

– O
This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location B-positive
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management B-negative
but O
Snooze B-positive
has O
people B-positive
climbing I-positive
over I-positive
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant B-negative
with O
mediocre O
food B-positive
and O
service B-negative
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer B-negative
location I-negative
will I-negative
go I-negative
unaddressed I-negative
. O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

Good O
Experience O

The O
lox O
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts B-negative
the I-negative
salads I-negative
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

Good O
drink O
. O

There O
is O
" O
Expensive-but-worth-it O
" O
and O
there O
is O
" O
Expensive-and-WTF O
" O
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

this O
little O
place B-negative
has O
a O
cute O
interior B-negative
decor I-negative
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

The O
location B-positive
and O
ambience B-positive
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place B-negative
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B-negative
scene I-negative
seems I-negative
to O
be O
happening O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches O
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything B-negative
like I-negative
chips I-negative
or I-negative
a O
side O
. O

The O
stuff O
tilapia O
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant B-negative
sound I-negative
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B-negative
to I-negative
go I-negative
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

The O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-negative
was O
divine O
! O
! O

Great O
vibe B-positive
, O
lots O
of O
people B-negative
. O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server B-negative
Brooke O
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food B-positive
anymore O
. O

The O
naan O
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha O
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

Fabulous O
food B-positive
- O
if O
the O
front B-negative
of I-negative
house I-negative
staff I-negative
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single O
Worst O
Restaurant B-negative
in O
Manhattan O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O
numbers O
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O
call O
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone O
. O

Go O
to O
japanese B-negative
sushi I-negative
place B-negative
or O
Spanish B-positive
tapas I-positive
place I-positive
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant B-negative
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen B-positive
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B-negative
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant B-negative
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable O
. O

Mmm O
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner O
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine B-positive
? O

The O
staff B-negative
offers O
impeccable O
service B-negative
. O

Great O
Indian B-positive
Food I-positive
! O

– O
As O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service B-negative
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft O
and O
bottle B-positive
selection I-positive
and O
the O
pizza B-positive
rocks O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

The O
wait B-negative
staff I-negative
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O
@ O
# O
$ O
* O
way O
) O
. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-positive
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-positive
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-negative
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish B-negative
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-negative
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-negative
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces B-negative
of I-negative
relatively I-negative
good O
nigiri B-positive
. O

When O
family B-positive
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps B-positive
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-negative
salad I-negative
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-positive
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-negative
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-neutral
sum I-neutral
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

Best O
In O
ALL O
of O
NYC O

Trust O
me O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis B-negative
go I-negative
wrong I-negative
; O
no O
where O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-positive
Japanese I-positive
brasserie I-positive
( O
that O
don O
’ O
t O
serve O
sushi B-negative
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-positive
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-positive
fries I-positive
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-negative
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family B-positive
back O
next O
time O
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-negative
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait B-negative
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll B-positive
and I-positive
Hyde I-positive
Pub I-positive
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-positive
shrimp I-positive
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

It O
? O
s O
served O
with O
either O
a O
peppercorn B-negative
sauce I-negative
or I-negative
red I-negative
wine I-negative
reduction I-negative
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O
taste O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables B-negative
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait B-negative
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner O
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O
. O

lobster B-positive
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

i O
actually O
feel B-positive
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

Very O
disappointed O
. O

Try O
the O
congee B-positive
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried B-neutral
dough I-neutral
they I-neutral
call I-neutral
Ow I-neutral
Ley I-neutral
Soh I-neutral
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet B-negative
tasting I-negative
bread I-negative
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian B-negative
dish I-negative
, O
the O
chef B-negative
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate B-negative
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
( O
minus B-negative
sauce I-negative
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form B-negative

. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair B-negative
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O

– O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
Ray's B-positive
Boathouse I-positive
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting B-negative
us I-negative
drinks I-negative
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B-negative
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian B-positive
food I-positive

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's O
reccomendation O

I O
know O
many O
people B-negative
have O
their O
favorite O
types B-positive
of I-positive

pizza B-negative
places O

but O
Mioposto's B-positive
pizza I-positive
lacks I-positive
quality O

good O
taste O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch O
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

This O
place B-negative
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners B-positive
afortune O
to O
build O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O

The O
portions B-negative
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-positive
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

Love O
their O

menu B-negative

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-positive

it O
will O
not O
be O

it O

Service B-positive
was O
kind O

our O
waitress B-negative
took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O

Its O
worth O
the O

give O
you O
a O
call O
when O
the O

we'd O
get O
an O
apology B-negative

complimentary I-negative

instead O

we O
got O
a O
snobby O

wouldn't O

take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O

gave O
us O

Next O

or O
try O
other O
restaurants O
close O

like O
Mimi's O

Claim O

The O
drinks B-positive
are O
great O
, O
especially O
when O
made O
by O
Raymond O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-positive
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
service B-negative
is O
awful O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
- O
- O
the O
food B-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade B-positive
with O
the O
perfect O
balance O
of O

tomatoes O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O
decor B-positive
, O
good O
service B-negative
, O
but O
the O
food B-positive
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
line O
very O
day O
of O
the O
week O
for O
the O
entire O
time O
a O
place B-negative

open O
, O
you O
know O
it O
is O
great O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O

except O
my O

had O
the O

The O

with O
two O

not O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
compensate O
for O
its O
very O
poor O
customer B-negative
service I-negative

The O
pizza B-positive
was O
slightly O
reminescent O
of O
Baker's O
Beach O
pizza B-positive
which O
occupied O
the O
the O
space B-negative
years O
ago O
( O
a O
distant O

The O
restaurant B-negative
was O
packed O
at O

so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar B-negative
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O

For O

I've O
been O
many O

and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

The O
servers B-negative
behind O
the O
counter B-negative
are O
always O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer B-negative

since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O

the O
different O
varieties O
of O

( O

The O

A O
real O
dissapointment O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
strikes O
you O
is O
the O
decor B-positive
? O
( O
not O
very O
pleasant O
) O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Their O
calzones O
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit-inducing O
, O
YUCK O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B-negative
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
courteous O
and O
attentive O
. O

Great O
food B-positive
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O

There O
are O
no O
negatives O

The O
duck B-positive
confit O
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie O

terrine O
with O

was O
out O
of O
this O

I O
love O
Dungeness O

and O
at O
Ray's B-neutral
you O
can O
get O
them O
served O
in O
about O
6 O
different O

I O
probably B-negative
wouldn't I-negative
go I-negative
back O
though O
' O
cuz O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O
worth O
it O

This O

the O
the O
correct O

an O

to O
make O
you O

the O

fairly O

The O

AVOID O
THE O
PLACE B-negative

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
SoCal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O
. O

Outside O
in O
the O
area O
between O
the O
restaurant B-negative

the O
park O
, O
children O
were O
running O
around O
while O
their O
parents O
sipped O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-negative

I O
was O
appalled O
. O

Great O
survice O

fresh O
restaurant B-negative
was O
amazing O
... O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course B-negative
fresh O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-negative
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant B-negative
. O

The O
mussels O
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert B-negative
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food B-positive
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
place B-negative
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken B-positive
tikka I-positive
masala I-positive
- O
no B-negative
bread I-negative
of I-negative
rice I-negative
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian B-positive
restaurant I-positive
but O
this O
place B-negative
doesn't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B-positive
. O

Our O
server B-negative
was O
very O
professional O
and O
friendly O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-positive
Shabu I-positive
, O
you O
won't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

As O
a O

i O
need O
a O
place B-negative

waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O

were O
never O
offered O
a O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O

$ O
60 O
a O

I O
expect O
better O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O

having O
lunch O

enough O
for O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden B-positive
spot I-positive

once O
you O

The O

The O
hot O

the O

the O
